# Contract Pack: Historical Progression

This contract pack is designed to take you through the history of the human space program. This entire contract pack was inspired by Whitecat106's Historic Missions contracts. He has created an incredible selection of close to 700 missions! For me, that is too much, and I wanted to go through the history of human spaceflight and progress how we have done in real life. I did not want to have to launch a mission that was almost the smae thing over and over again.

This contract pack takes you from the first sounding rockets to New Horizons and into the future. You will be tasked with recreating some of the most ambitious missions like the Apollo Program, Voyager and the International Space Station. It is up to you to guide the Kerbals into the cosmos through a historical progression.

Some of these contracts are very involved and require you to use gravity assists to accomplish the contract parameters. Others give you the option to complete certain goals in order to gain bonuses. For example, in your Space Shuttle contracts, you get bonus funds if you land your shuttle on the Runway back at KSC. One of the best examples of this is the MESSENGER contract. It requires you to enter a polar orbit of the first planet in the solar system. We will use the stock system  with the Real Solar System planets as an example.

### MESSENGER Contract Parameters

General Goal: Design an unmanned craft to Orbit Moho (Mercury) with a minimum Inclination of 70 degrees

1. Design an unmanned craft with an antenna (also with 3 SCANsat scanners if you have the mod installed)
2. Launch MESSENGER
3. Enter Orbit of the Sun
4. OPTIONAL BONUS: Flyby Kerbin (Earth) for a gravity assist
5. OPTIONAL BONUS: Flyby Eve (Venus) for a gravity assist
6. OPTIONAL BONUS: Flyby Eve (Venus) again for a gravity assist
7. OPTIONAL BONUS: Flyby Moho (Mercury) for a gravity assist
8. OPTIONAL BONUS: Flyby Moho (Mercury) again for a gravity assist
9. OPTIONAL BONUS: Flyby Moho (Mercury) for the third time for a gravity assist
10. Enter Orbit of Moho (Mercury) with a minimum Inclination of 70 degrees
11. Transmit Science Data from Space around Moho (Mercury)
12. If you have SCANsat installed, have 80% mapping of Low Quality, Biome and High Quality

Most of the missions are not that difficult or that involved, but MESSENGER was launched in 2004 after more than 50 years of spaceflight and we knew some new tricks to help us achieve an orbit.

**REQUIRED MODS**
* Contract Configurator - http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/101604
* Module Manager - http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/55219

**HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED MODS**
These are not nessecary to use the contract pack, but it makes the pack much better
* Unmanned Before Manned - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/106130)
  * This lets you start with the proper probe cores instead of manned missions, the contract pack might not be possible to complete without this or something similar
* Outer Planets Mod - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/93999-112-outer-planets-mod-20-complete-overhaul-better-terrain-nicer-terrain-textures-improved-scatter-etc-21-may/)
  * If you are playing with stock KSP, this will give you the extra planets that simulate the outer solar system and will allow you to explore these places with contracts like New Horizons and Voyager 1 and 2
* Real Solar System
  * If you are up for it, you can recreate some of the most famous missions in different scaled Real Solar Systems
  * Real Solar System - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50471-113-real-solar-system-v1140-july-3/)
  * Half Size Real Solar System - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/142336-113-half-size-rss-v15/)
  * Stock Size Real Solar System - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/138572-wip-113-117-stock-size-real-solar-system/)
* DMagic Orbital Science - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/59009-113-dmagic-orbital-science-new-science-parts-v132-6272016/)
  * This gives you more science experiments to use on your various missions around the solar system
* SCANsat - (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/72679-113-scansat-v163-real-scanning-real-science-at-warp-speed-june-27-2016/)
  * This provides you with parts to map the planets in the solar system. The contracts have support for Scanning missions if SCANsat is installed.
* Life Support Mods
  * There are many to choose from, but I reccomend picking at least one of them. Some of these contracts are setting new duration records in space and there is no real challenge to them without having Life Support of some kind.
  
**OTHER MODS TO CONSIDER**
There are many part mods to consider that will give you the ability to construct realistic looking, or in some cases replicas of the spacecraft that are simulated in this contract pack.
* Bluedog Design Bureau (NASA / ESA)
* FASA (NASA)
* Raidernick's Awesome Collection of Mods
  * Skylab
  * US & Soviet Solar Panels Pack
  * Salyut Stations
  * Soviet Spacecraft
  * Soviet Probes
  * US Probes Pack
  * US Rockets Pack
  * Antares & Cygnus  
  
**NOTES**
* The contract removes the World Firsts and Explore Body stock missions as we are already covering this with the pack
* This contract pack works with all planet packs, but you will experience some weird contracts if your Home planet is not the 3rd rock from the sun
* Full support for Stock, Stock x2, Stock x6.4, Outer Planets Mod
* Full support for Real Solar System, Half Size Real Solar System, Stock Size Real Solar System
* I do not know how this will play with other Contract Packs unless listed below, as it is designed to go through all major "firsts" of our space history so will duplicate similar contracts from other packs
* Most missions cannot be cancelled nor will they expire. There are a set of optional missions and more will be coming down the line. These optional missions can be cancelled and do not need to be completed.

* Anomoly Surveyor
* AntennaRange Relays
